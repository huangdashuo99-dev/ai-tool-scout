# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

## Checklist

1. **Explore project context** - check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** - with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** - in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** - save to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
6. **Spec self-review** - quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** - ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** - invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways?

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
